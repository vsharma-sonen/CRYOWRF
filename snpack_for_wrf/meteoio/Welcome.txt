The MeteoIO library aims at making data access easy and safe for numerical simulations in environmental sciences requiring general meteorological data. MeteoIO's main design goals are:
    * providing data format/protocol independent data access
    * providing safe and robust I/O
    * making I/O code as unobtrusive and simple as possible for the user
    * providing ready to use data to the user, which means transparent caching, filtering, resampling, spatial interpolation.
    * enabling unattended use from an IO point of view
    * offering high modularity so that individual elements of the library can easily be replaced/expanded/added
    * by its modularity, help interdisciplinary development, each module being targeted at a specific developer profile

MeteoIO is a C++ library provided with complete documentation (tutorials, code examples, API's documentation) under the LGPL v3 license. As such, feel free to contribute! You are also encouraged to drop us a line if you use MeteoIO, this is a great way to support us!
